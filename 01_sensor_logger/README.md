# Task 01 - Sensor Logger 

## 📋 Objective
Create a simple simulation of environmental sensors using Python’s object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## ✅ Concepts Practiced
- Classes and objects
- Instance and class attributes
- Instance methods and class methods
- `__str__` for readable object output
- Unit testing with Python’s `unittest`

## 🗂️ Files
- `sensor.py`: Defines the `Sensor` class
- `test_sensor.py`: Unit tests to validate class functionality
- `main.py`: Runs a sample simulation using the `Sensor` class

## 🔍 Sample Output

```bash
Sensor 2 is located in Dresde and currently reads 591C
Sensor 3 is located in Berlin and currently reads 638C
Sensor 67 is located in Colombo 5 and currently reads 92C
There are 3 instances generated from the Sensor class
```

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How <code style="color : purple">to structure</code> a simple <code style="color : purple">class</code> with clean attributes and methods
- Why `@classmethod` is used for class-level tracking
- How to test behavior with `unittest`
- How <code style="color : purple"> to structure</code> code for reuse and readability

## 📂 Next Step
Refactor sensor logging into a data manager that can handle multiple files and readings over time.
